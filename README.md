# Predicting-Employee-Retention

Employee retention is a critical factor in maintaining organizational stability, productivity, and morale. High turnover rates can result in increased recruitment and training costs, as well as lost productivity. To proactively manage this challenge, a mid-sized technology company seeks to predict which employees are likely to remain with the organization. This model is intended to analyze binary outcomes (retain or not) based on various features from the dataset, such as demographic details, job satisfaction scores, performance metrics, and tenure. This predictive capability will allow HR teams to implement strategic interventions and enhance employee satisfaction and engagement. This project involves building a Logistic Regression model to predict employee retention using a dataset containing features such as age, gender, department, job satisfaction, performance rating, tenure, and more. The current goal is to proactively identify employees who are likely to stay. This will allow management to foster a more loyal and committed workforce by understanding and addressing factors influencing employee loyalty. The model is expected to classify employees into two categories: those likely to stay and those likely to leave.
